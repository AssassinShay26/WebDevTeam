            <p>Johnny grew up in a small town where music was the only escape from his mundane routine. His older brother handed him a dusty bass guitar one summer, and it was love at first pluck. Known for his cool, laid-back demeanor, Johnny's smooth basslines became the foundation of the band's sound. He's the quiet one, but when he speaks, his dry humor and deep insights leave everyone laughing or thinking.</p></div><!--LORE: Poor kid from San Antonio with a troublesome life style gets out of his home town moves to canada with more chaos happening then moves back to meet the rest of band-->

            <p>Ronnie is the heart of the band, both rhythmically and emotionally. Coming from a family of percussionists, he started banging on pots and pans before he could walk. His boundless energy and knack for improvisation make him a powerhouse behind the drum kit. Offstage, he's the life of the party, always hyping the group up and keeping the vibe light, even during tough times. </p></div>

            <p>Beatrice, often called Bea, grew up singing in her church choir, but her rebellious streak led her to rock. With a voice that can melt hearts or ignite a crowd, she's the band's driving force and emotional anchor. Her lyrics, drawn from personal struggles and triumphs, resonate deeply with their fans. Fiercely independent, she's a natural leader but also deeply protective of her bandmates, whom she considers her second family.</p></div>

    <h1 class="HWSh1">How We Started</h1>
        <p class="HWSp">
            It all started in 2023, in a cramped garage on the outskirts of Columbus. Im Beatrice, the lead vocalist of Stage Fright, and back then, none of us thought we'd make it past our first gig. Johnny, our bassist, was the one who convinced me to give rock a try. He'd been noodling around with his brother's old guitar when we met at a local open mic. His calm, steady vibe was the glue that held us together, even when everything else felt like chaos. Ronnie, on the other hand, was pure fire. He was already a local legend on the drums before we roped him in. You couldn't miss him—always tapping on tables or turning any surface into a makeshift drum kit. He had this energy that felt unstoppable, and when he joined us, it felt like the missing puzzle piece clicked into place. The name "Stage Fright" came from a joke—we were all terrible at performing in front of people at first. Our first show was in a dingy bar with a broken PA system, but something clicked that night. Despite the shaky start, we saw people vibing to our music, and for the first time, it felt like we belonged somewhere. We weren't just a band; we became a family. Through late-night jam sessions, bad coffee, and worse gigs, we found our sound. It wasn't perfect, but it was raw and real—just like us. And that's all we ever wanted to be.
